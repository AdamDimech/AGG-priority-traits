# AGG Priority Traits
This repository contains data from the Australian Grain Genebank's November 2023 Community of Practice meeting. At this meeting, participants were asked:

- What are the most important AGG-collected traits (up to five) for your research?
- Are any non-collected traits important for your research?
- Can you list any other traits-of-interest?

The selected crops were:
- Barley
- Chickpea
- Lentil
- Mung Bean
- Wheat

The data was collected via Microsoft Teams polls. Original data files are saved in a ZIP file under */zip*. Extracted data files are found in */data*. The R analysis pipeline is found in */R/agg-priority-traits.r* and the output summary is available in Excel (XLSX) and Comma-Separated-Values (CSV) formats in */output*.
